# Which OS is best?

In my short time on this earth, I have used the big three operating systems of Windows, OSX, and the Ubuntu Linux distro, and I have some thoughts on which is best. Do these operating systems need to be compared? Absolutely not, each is unique in its own way, and serves a different function for different kinds of users. I will be evaluating these operating systems based on my own unique criteria of needing a reliable OS to:

* Write software
* Play games
* Use old-school emulators
* Explore computers and their underlying concepts
* Complete schoolwork
* Produce music

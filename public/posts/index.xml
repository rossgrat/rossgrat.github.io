      <title>Whist Tournaments for Euchre</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dad has a friend that holds an annual Euchre tournament each year on St. Patties day. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big deal, anywhere from 20-30 people will show up to see who takes home a non-trivial cash prize. The format is unique and very similar to a round-robin style tournament, but with a twist. Each round the teams are randomly chosen via each person pulling a piece of paper out of a hat. The system is simple, but there are some problems such as players playing each other multiple times or having the same partner multiple times, which is why I was approached to write a program to improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;edit---july-15th-2024&#34;&gt;Edit - July 15th, 2024:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After about a month of attempting this system I am putting it on pause. There are a few problems I have encountered thus far:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Despite setting a goal of 7 hours per week, I have not put in place a real system to achieve this goal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;7 hours per week is difficult to achieve during weeks of extended work or vacation, the system does not account for this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reflecting once a week is difficult given that 7 hours of a more bland activity such as reading a textbook do not tranneutral into interesting reflections.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finding time to write a blog post once a week has thus far proven difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be clear I am not putting my continuous education on pause, just the system conceptualized in the original post of tracking and recording my education progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first ever post for the third iteration of my personal website that now features blogging thanks to the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; static site generator. In this post I want to explain my thoughts about what should go on the site, touch on some of the technologies used to build the site, and briefly discuss my thoughts on the look of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-should-go-on-the-website&#34;&gt;What should go on the website?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The software engineer/developer portfolio websites I have seen usually look similar to a resume, with sections such as &amp;ldquo;work experience&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;skills&amp;rdquo;, etc. To me these types of websites violate the principle of DRY. If all of this information is in a resume, why repeat it on a website? Now the same text in two locations needs to be updated whenever something changes. Three locations if your Linkedin page functions as another copy of your resume.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

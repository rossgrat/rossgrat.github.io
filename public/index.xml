      <description>One of the biggest things I miss the most about college is the constant learning. Every day I was exposed to new concepts and ideas. Although I feel that I have learned a lot in my short professional career, there are some pitfalls that I have noticed.&#xA;I feel that it is entirely too easy to slip into a rut of complacency at work. Once I have figured out what does the job, what incentive do I have to try and make that thing better?</description>

      <description>My dad has a friend that holds an annual Euchre tournament each year on St. Patties day. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big deal, anywhere from 20-30 people will show up to see who takes home a hefty cash prize. The format is unique and very similar to a round-robin style tournament, but with a twist. Each round the teams are randomly chose via each person pulling a piece of paper out of a hat.</description>

      <description>This is the first ever post for the third iteration of my personal website that now features blogging thanks to the excellent Hugo static site generator. In this post I want to explain my thoughts about what should go on the site, touch on some of the technologies used to build the site, and briefly discuss my thoughts on the look of the site.&#xA;What should go on the website? The software engineer/developer portfolio websites I have seen usually look similar to a resume, with sections such as &amp;ldquo;work experience&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;skills&amp;rdquo;, etc.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dad has a friend that holds an annual Euchre tournament each year on St. Patties day. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big deal, anywhere from 20-30 people will show up to see who takes home a non-trivial cash prize. The format is unique and very similar to a round-robin style tournament, but with a twist. Each round the teams are randomly chosen via each person pulling a piece of paper out of a hat. The system is simple, but there are some problems such as players playing each other multiple times or having the same partner multiple times, which is why I was approached to write a program to improve the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
